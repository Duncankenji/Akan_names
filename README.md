Generating Akan_names from date of birth

This project helps get Akan names given a persons' day, month, and year of birth, also their gender, now that in Ghananian culter boys and girls get different names depending on the day of the week they were born. 

Getting Started
To get the project running , run the main html - akan_names.html in your browser. I used chrome for this development. But you can also use mozila.

Prerequisites
I did this on linux server, also needed atom as my development platform, chrome, bootstrap for styling, and ofcourse saved my changes to github.

I created my work environment backend on the linux box, gave it a name. Then created index html file inside this directory. Also created js file inside this directory for my JavaScript files, and css file for my css files.
I then edited my index html file on atom , adding form elements for displaying - prompting the user for birth of date details. The user is prompted to enter his/her day, month , and year they were born. The system then calculates their Akan names, from the JavaScript.

css file linked to the index html gives the page a beautifil view.


The program prompts the user for his date of birth, then calculates their Akan name depending on the day of the week they were born.

I used Zeller congruence formular for the day calculation
